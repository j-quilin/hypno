        <h2>Energy Work</h2>
        <p>
        Reiki is a hands on healing modality. This energy is said to be the
        universal healing life force that flows through all living things and keeps
        us connected and healthy. It's origin is from India and the East. It is said
        that it's has been practice in times before Christ and the Buddha. In China
        it's the Chi. In most religions is the Holy Spirit. The Higher Power for
        others. Anyone can tap in into the universal life force and when it flows
        freely in and outside of us we are at our healthiest and happiest. All seems
        to flow smoothly. However worries, bad diet, poor habits and no exercise
        can cause blockages of this healing energy and we become depressed,
        anxious, ill, hopeless and so on.
        <br>
        I work with the seven main energy points in the body called chakras. Light
        placing of the hands to these points and trouble areas help activate reiki
        energy. This stimulates your own natural healing properties. This energy
        will flow freely and healing begins to take place. Some describe their reiki
        experience as a warm sensation, vibration of the skin and muscles, some
        see colors, deep relaxation and restful sleep. Overall a reiki session helps
        promotes deep relaxation, mental clarity and both emotional and physical
        relief. Reiki is not a cure but it is a wonderful addition to treatments of
        any kind to aid in recovery.
        <br>
        A Reiki Session is 60 to 80 min long. Session are done in a safe private
        professional setting. Where the client will have some time to safely
        express areas of emotional/physical concern(s). Client will then be placed
        in a comfortable recliner bed. Clothes stay on, so make sure to come in
        comfortable attire. A guided meditation will help the client ease into a
        relaxed meditative state. Crystals and stones are used in the session to aid
        energy flow. Reiki is then administered.
        <br>
        One session may help induce healing, clarity and deep relaxation, help to
        start the emotional healing of letting go of past traumas, blockages. Ease
        stress and promote self love and emotional and physical healing.
        Recommended for all those who seek spiritual guidance, a moment of
        relaxation, reduce stress, vent, general well-being, curiosity. A minimum
        of 4 consecutively sessions are recommended to boost the flow of healing
        energy.
