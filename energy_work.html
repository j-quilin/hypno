      <p>Energy work
      Reiki is a hands on healing modality. This energy is said to be the
      universal healing life force that flows through all living things and keeps
      us connected and healthy. It's origin is from India and the East. It is said
      that it's has been practice in times before Christ and the Buddha. In China
      it's the Chi. In most religions is the Holy Spirit. The Higher Power for
      others. Anyone can tap in into the universal life force and when it flows
      freely in and outside of us we are at our healthiest and happiest. All seems
      to flow smoothly. However worries, bad diet, poor habits and no exercise
      can cause blockages of this healing energy and we become depressed,
      anxious, ill, hopeless and so on.
      <br>
      I work with the seven main energy points in the body called chakras. Light
      placing of the hands to these points and trouble areas help activate reiki
      energy. This stimulates your own natural healing properties. This energy
      will flow freely and healing begins to take place. Some describe their reiki
      experience as a warm sensation, vibration of the skin and muscles, some
      see colors, deep relaxation and restful sleep. Overall a reiki session helps
      promotes deep relaxation, mental clarity and both emotional and physical
      relief. Reiki is not a cure but it is a wonderful addition to treatments of
      any kind to aid in recovery.
      <br>
      A Reiki Session is 60 to 80 min long. Session are done in a safe private
      professional setting. Where the client will have some time to safely
      express areas of emotional/physical concern(s). Client will then be placed
      in a comfortable recliner bed. Clothes stay on, so make sure to come in
      comfortable attire. A guided meditation will help the client ease into a
      relaxed meditative state. Crystals and stones are used in the session to aid
      energy flow. Reiki is then administered.
      <br>
      One session may help induce healing, clarity and deep relaxation, help to
      start the emotional healing of letting go of past traumas, blockages. Ease
      stress and promote self love and emotional and physical healing.
      Recommended for all those who seek spiritual guidance, a moment of
      relaxation, reduce stress, vent, general well-being, curiosity. A minimum
      of 4 consecutively sessions are recommended to boost the flow of healing
      energy.
